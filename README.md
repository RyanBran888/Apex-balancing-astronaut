# Apex-balancing-astronaut
apex! apex! apex! space! yayayayaya! yippeee! space robot!!!!

# what is it????????
its a robot! that balances a ball on a plate, the goal is for the robot (who is going up on a weather balloon) to balance a ball on his plate without it falling off, despite the twisty and turny actions of the balloon

# what we needed to do it
  a raspberry pico to hold our code
  a MPU-6050 to measure the angles that the robot is at
  2 servos to mpove the robots plate back into position
  3d prints too make the robot a robot!
# how did we get to where we are?
